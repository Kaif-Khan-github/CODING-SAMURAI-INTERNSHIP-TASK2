# 🛳️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The main objective is to uncover meaningful insights, visualize key patterns, and understand the variables that influenced passenger survival.

---

## 📌 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like:

- **Passenger Class (Pclass)**
- **Name**
- **Sex**
- **Age**
- **Siblings/Spouses Aboard (SibSp)**
- **Parents/Children Aboard (Parch)**
- **Fare**
- **Embarked Location**
- **Survival Status (Target Variable)**

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Handle missing data and perform data cleaning
- Conduct univariate and multivariate analysis
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Identify trends related to survival rate

---

## 📊 EDA Highlights

- Checked data types, missing values, and descriptive stats
- Cleaned the dataset (handled nulls in `Age`, `Embarked`, dropped `Cabin`)
- Visualized:
  - Survival distribution
  - Survival by gender and class
  - Age distribution and relation to survival
  - Fare vs Age using scatter plots
  - Correlation heatmap

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Females had a higher survival rate** than males.
- **1st class passengers survived more** than those in 2nd and 3rd class.
- **Younger passengers** had a slightly better chance of survival.
- **Higher fares** are linked with a higher chance of survival (likely due to class).
- **Most passengers boarded from port 'S' (Southampton)**.
